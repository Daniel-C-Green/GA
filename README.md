# GA <img src="images/logo.png" align="right" width="100px" />

An R package for optimisation using **Genetic
Algorithms**

[![CRAN\_Status\_Badge](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/GA)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=GA)
[![CRAN\_MonthlyDownloads](http://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/GA)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=GA)

The GA package provides a flexible general-purpose set of tools for
implementing genetic algorithms search in both the continuous and
discrete case, whether constrained or not. Users can easily define their
own objective function depending on the problem at hand. Several genetic
operators are available and can be combined to explore the best settings
for the current task. Furthermore, users can define new genetic
operators and easily evaluate their performances. Local search using
general-purpose optimisation algorithms can be applied stochastically to
exploit interesting regions. GAs can be run sequentially or in parallel,
using an explicit master-slave parallelisation or a coarse-grain islands
approach.

## Installation

You can install the released version of GA from CRAN:

``` r
install.packages("GA")
```

or the development version from GitHub:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("luca-scr/GA")
```

## Usage

Usage of the main functions and several examples are included in the
papers shown in the references section below.

For an intro see the vignette **A quick tour of GA**, which is available
as

``` r
vignette("GA")
```

Note that if the package is installed from GitHub the vignette is not
automatically created. However, it can be created when installing from
GitHub with the code:

``` r
devtools::install_github("luca-scr/GA", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

The vignette is also available in the *Get Started* section on the
GitHub web page of the package at <http://luca-scr.github.io/GA/>.
